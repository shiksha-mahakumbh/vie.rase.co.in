 "Abstract": "This research paper delves into the nuanced challenges faced by the agrarian community in North Haryana, particularly among its youth, in embracing entrepreneurial pursuits. A prevalent trend among the youth is aspiring to relocate abroad. It seems like there might be a few typos or errors in the text you provided. Land is a fundamental resource, yet why don't the people of this community move towards agripreneurship? Previous articles on entrepreneurial intentions have extensively covered various factors influencing motivations to start an entrepreneurial venture or a business. However, it appears that certain issues, particularly those prevalent in rural agrarian communities, have been overlooked. A significant revelation is the influence of the youth's upbringing or caste, which, although not explicitly prohibiting them from venturing into sales-related businesses, instills a preconceived notion that they lack the ability to excel in such endeavors. They resist diversifying crops, adhering to traditional sugarcane, wheat, and rice cultivation, seeking government-backed channels for sales. There exists a pervasive belief that tasks associated with sales, including connecting with clients, procuring materials, and selling products, are inherently challenging and not suited for them. Furthermore, this apprehension is fueled by a fear of being ridiculed by peers and an obsessive societal inclination towards traditional safe, secure jobs. The paper underscores the need for a paradigm shift in societal perspectives, urging a reevaluation of ingrained beliefs that hinder the youth's potential. As global trends increasingly favor organic and holistic approaches to eating and preventive healthcare, the research underscores the potential for agriculture-based startups in providing a sustainable livelihood. Emphasizing food as a cornerstone of well-being, the paper advocates for a shift in perspective within the agrarian community, urging a reconsideration of traditional career paths and a more informed exploration of the diverse opportunities available in the market for farmers.",

     "Title": "Introduction",
     "Content": "A nation's greatness is intricately tied to its ability to provide employment opportunities, ensure earning means through job creation, high standard of living by innovating standardized goods and services (Shane& Venkataraman 2000, Laukkanen 2000). Entrepreneurship stands out as the pathway to achieve these pivotal elements. In India, the focus on entrepreneurship has intensified since 2016, recognizing its role as the backbone of a robust economy. Numerous programs have been launched to address the scarcity of entrepreneurial spirit, particularly among the younger population. Over the past few years, the Indian government has demonstrated its commitment by offering support to entrepreneurs through mechanisms like MUDRA loans, incubation centers in universities, the Fund of Funds for Startup Scheme, Export Promotion to Handicraft Products, Startup India Seed Fund Scheme, and the Small Industries Development Organization, Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups. Despite these initiatives, there Creating a conducive entrepreneurial environment is the first essential step towards fostering entrepreneurship intention. While the government has made strides in establishing support systems, the awareness and significance of these efforts, particularly in the realms of entrepreneurial education and the intention to start a business, remain modest. This awareness gap is particularly pronounced among individuals not already involved in businesses. Many things assist to entrepreneurship intention. Family environment, consisting of supportive attitudes, values, and available resources, significantly influences entrepreneurial intention (Shapero 1982, Aldrich & Cliff 2003, Fatoki 2015). Risk propensity to embark on venture creation positively impact entrepreneurial intention (Bezzinga 2010, Belas et al. 2015, Zhao et al. 2005). A positive inclination towards risk-taking has a notable impact on both entrepreneurship intention. Self-efficacy also regarded as perceived feasibility of starting an enterprise, venture positively affect entrepreneurship intention (Zhao at al. 2005). Entrepreneurship education is another important factor where the acquisition of concepts and skills to identify opportunities, marketing, finance management skill becomes pivotal for initiating a business (Crant 1996, Byabashaija & Katono 2011, Zhao et al. 2005). Particularly for individuals in their formative years, such as those in college or school, perceived social pressures, peer support play a crucial role in shaping entrepreneurial intentions (Naneh 2022). To succeed, entrepreneurs need technical knowledge, mentorship, social and family support, and financial backing. The early years of venture establishment demand tremendous effort, making the cultivation of a favorable entrepreneurial environment even more critical.India, often hailed as the epitome of an emerging market, holds immense potential in the realm of agriculture. In the pursuit of sustainable community-oriented agriculture, the concept of agripreneurship takes center stage. This innovative approach envisions a direct-marketed agricultural system that not only harnesses the vast expanses of aggregable land in the country but also solution to rural livelihoods and unemployment that confront a significant portion (909 million) of India's large population. By empowering individuals as agripreneurs, this approach not only revitalizes rural economies but also addresses the pressing issue of unemployment. Sah (2009) stated that developing entrepreneurs in agriculture will solve the problem like, rural unemployment and migration from rural to urban areas.Despite the substantial potential that agriculture and agribusiness hold in the Indian context, there persists a notable lag in rural areas in adopting agripreneurship. This paper has approached agripreneurship from the perspectives of agricultural production and the marketing and selling of agricultural products. This paper aims to delve into the factors contributing to this phenomenon by specifically focusing on the rural community of North Haryana. Through a comprehensive qualitative inquiry, the paper seeks to address the pivotal question of why agripreneurship has not gained significant traction in these regions. By engaging directly with the rural community, the research aims to uncover the challenges, barriers, and perceptions that hinder the widespread adoption of agripreneurship in this specific geographic context. Through a nuanced examination of these factors, the paper aspires to contribute valuable insights toward fostering a more conducive environment for agripreneurial adoption in rural India.",

     "Title": "Review of Literature",
     "Content": "An individual whose primary business revolves around agriculture or agriculture-related activities is termed an agripreneur, as defined by Dobson and Markley in 2010. Nassir (2017) provides an explanation of Agripreneurship as the application of entrepreneurial principles within the agricultural domain. Entrepreneurship, in essence, underscores the process of transforming an idea into a viable business or the expansion of an existing enterprise. Despite the numerous benefits that entrepreneurship offers to the economy and individuals, various barriers, act as deterrents, impeding the widespread adoption of entrepreneurship as a viable earning tool Many previous studies have explored different obstacles to entrepreneurship (Gould and Parzen 1990; Kwapisz, 2019, and Raeesi et al., 2013. Bosma et al. in 2009 investigated that primary psychological hurdle to entrepreneurship is the apprehension of failure through General Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) research model and global country-level data. The various types of barriers are listed below: 1 Institutional barriers encompass factors like inadequate government support, limited financial backing from public sectors or governmental entities, deficient regional infrastructure, ineffective legislation, widespread corruption, and insufficient entrepreneurial education and training, as noted by Benzing et al. in 2009, Chu et al. in 2007, Ivy in 1997, and Kiggundu in 2002, Jain and Ali in 2013 2 Some studies have pointed political, economic, social, and legal hindrances to entrepreneurship. These may range from discriminatory practices based on gender, race, or ethnicity to a scarcity of entrepreneurial resources, low levels of entrepreneurial activity in a country or region, restrictive government regulations, and liquidity constraints. - Issues such as banks refusing loans to startups, the ineffectiveness of entrepreneurial education, and negative assumptions about entrepreneurs (Estrin et al. 2006, 2013; Estrin and Mickiewicz 2011; Yukhanaev et al. 2015). Economic-operational factors hindering venture success due to the liability of smallness and unfair competition (Kouriloff 2000; Pitelis 2009).Infrastructure barriers include an undeveloped transportation sector or outdated manufacturing facilities/equipment (Bartlett and Bukvič 2001; Gill et al. 2011; Xheneti and Bartlett 2012). Arbitrary limits imposed by banks on the amount entrepreneurs can borrow also contribute to these barriers, as highlighted by Mahto et al. in 2020. And there are social-institutional factors making it difficult for a new venture to gain stakeholder acceptance and assistance, attributed to the liability of newness (Aldrich and Auster 1986; Pitelis 2009). 3. Psychological Barriers: Adopting an entrepreneurial mindset and lifestyle is crucial for identifying opportunities, presenting a prerequisite attribute for entrepreneurship. These barriers encompass cognitive-psychological challenges, posing difficulties for aspiring entrepreneurs in managing a growing venture (Hsu et al. 2019; Khanin et al. 2009; Wasserman 2003). These barriers could be perfectly categorized as tangible and perceived barriers (Belousova et al. 2020; Kwapisz 2019; Raeesi et al. 2013). Indian youth face social attitudes, skill deficiencies, insufficient entrepreneurship education, limited work experience, inadequate capitalization, absence of networks, and market barriers(Potabatti and Boob, 2015).",

     "Title": "Research Gap: Barriers to Agripreneurship",
     "Content": "As explained above, there are numerous studies which have explored barriers to entrepreneurship in a broad context. Wongtschwski et al. (2013), the study suggests that farmers, despite their inherent innovativeness and creativity, often encounter limitations due to insufficient experiences, restricted access to services and markets, and a lack of skills essential for achieving realistic success as entrepreneurs. Agripreneurs have elevated levels of motivational development compared to those who selected alternative career paths (Collins et al. 2004). However, there are very few studies explaining agribusiness barriers and motivations.",

     "Title": "Significance of the Study",
     "Content": "Given that agripreneurship encompasses unique demands, needs, limitations, and barriers exclusive to its domain, a comprehensive understanding of the specific challenges hindering progress becomes imperative. This academic pursuit ensures a nuanced comprehension of the intricacies and barriers that characterize agripreneurial endeavors.This research paper delves into the often-overlooked challenge of cultivating entrepreneurial intentions within Haryana's agrarian community. The deliberate choice of focusing on North Haryana, particularly in the context of the prevailing unemployment crisis, holds significant importance. In this region, the youth are compelled to seek opportunities abroad, contributing to a demographic challenge for Haryana. Notably, these migrating youth primarily belong to the agrarian community, possessing available land for agricultural production. Despite such potential, the question arises as to why they are not actively engaging in agripreneurship. This research is to formulate a theory related to opportunity identificationand realization (Grégoire and Shepherd 2012; Shepherd et al. 2020; Short et al. 2010).This research addresses the intricate interplay of socioeconomic factors contributing to the underutilization of the region's vast agribusiness potential, examining the paradox of unexplored opportunities amid the agrarian landscape.",

     "Content": " This research was exploratory and qualitative in nature. The primary data for this study was gathered through extensive group discussions and interviews within the agrarian community of Haryana. Open-ended conversations were conducted with community members, especially youth focusing on their perceptions of employment, entrepreneurship, and the challenges faced in pursuing the latter.To generate insights, participants were free to share their ideas, whatever they felt about agribusiness opportunities, their perception of employment and entrepreneurship Qualitative research design with focus groups and interviews is used to explore in depth information regarding any concept or phenomenon (Dimitra et al., 2020). Adopting qualitative research methodology, the topic analysis was continual and adaptive throughout the research process (Arnould & Wallendorf, 1994). The group process was based on freewheeling discussion, facilitator noted the crucial details. The qualitative research design is used to delve deeply into existing phenomena and emerging themes lying in thoughts and opinions. In quantitative research, it is stated by the researcher how many people hold particular beliefs. However, here in focus group research, providing a precise number of participants that hold a particular belief may lead to misunderstanding and misleading conclusions. That is why, along the lines of Rachel Brooks, researchers used phrases like *majority of participants* or *few participants* as the data is collected at a group level.",

When questioned about their decision to migrate abroad for manual labor jobs rather than pursuing similar opportunities in India, respondents cited several factors. Firstly, they emphasized the distance from their social and familial circles, considering it a less impactful aspect in a foreign setting. Secondly, the prospect of earning substantial and sufficient income within a few years, enabling them to build a house in India, played a pivotal role in their decision-making process. Additionally, the allure of freedom and the inspiration drawn from individuals who have previously migrated and achieved significant success abroad served as further motivation for their aspiration to move overseas.Low awareness and No Discussion about Agribusiness: A significant proportion of the agrarian community and youth exhibited a lack of awareness regarding the diverse opportunities available in the market for farmers."

 "Conclusion": "As global trends increasingly favour organic and holistic approaches to eating and preventive healthcare, this paper highlights the underestimated challenge of cultivating agrientrepreneurial intentions within Haryana's agrarian community. Emphasizing food as a cornerstone of wellbeing, the paper advocates for a shift in perspective within the agrarian community, urging exploration of the diverse opportunities available in the market for farmers. The factor of perceived societal bias (ethnicity or caste bias) and lack of social discourse regarding agribusiness must be addressed. To promote the social discourse, well informed initiatives and knowledge driven marketing campaign About the benefits of adopting agribusiness and ways to move towards agribusiness from the government should be addressed to farmers community. By promoting a paradigm shift in societal perspectives and encouraging agriculture-based startups, Haryana's agrarian community can unlock untapped potential, fostering economic growth and sustainable livelihoods.  ",
 "Recommendations": "To make change, establish the example:Establish support systems, including mentorship programs to encourage and facilitate the launch of agribusiness.Implement awareness campaigns to educate the agrarian youth about diverse opportunities available in the market for farmers.Initiate skill development programs focused on entrepreneurship and business management tailored for the agrarian community.",
